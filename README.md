Halo! I'm RahmaðŸ‘‹, a student of SMK Telkom Malang, a developer passionate about technology. Currently, I focus on software engineering and am always looking for ways to improve my skills. One of my favorite projects is native_library, which reflects my interest in information and technology.

Apart from coding, I also like traveling. If you want to connect or discuss technology, feel free to contact me at rdyah260@gmail.com or use the link below.
